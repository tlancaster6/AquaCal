This section explains the theory behind AquaCal's calibration approach. Each page is self-contained — you can jump to any topic without reading others first.

## Theory Pages

- [Refractive Geometry](refractive_geometry.md) — How light rays refract at the air-water interface, refractive projection, and ray tracing
- **Coordinate Conventions** — World frame, camera frame, pixel coordinates, and transformations (coming in Task 2)
- **Optimizer Pipeline** — Four-stage calibration pipeline and bundle adjustment structure (coming in Task 2)
