This section explains the theory behind AquaCal's calibration approach. Each page is self-contained — you can jump to any topic without reading others first.

## Theory Pages

- [Refractive Geometry](refractive_geometry.md) — How light rays refract at the air-water interface, refractive projection, and ray tracing
- [Coordinate Conventions](coordinates.md) — World frame, camera frame, pixel coordinates, and transformations
- [Optimizer Pipeline](optimizer.md) — Four-stage calibration pipeline and bundle adjustment structure
