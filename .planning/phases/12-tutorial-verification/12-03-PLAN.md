<objective>
User verifies that both tutorials run correctly and provide a clear learning path.

Purpose: Satisfy TUT-01 and TUT-02 requirements with human confirmation.
Output: User approval of tutorial quality.

  <name>User verification of tutorial quality</name>
  <what-built>
Two restructured Jupyter tutorials with pre-executed outputs:
- **Tutorial 01** (Full Pipeline + Diagnostics): End-to-end calibration with merged diagnostics section
- **Tutorial 02** (Synthetic Validation): Three progressive experiments showing why refractive calibration matters
Plus updated index page and deleted old files.
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Open `docs/tutorials/01_full_pipeline.ipynb` in Jupyter and verify:
   - All cells have outputs (pre-executed)
   - Diagnostics section is present and informative
   - Summary links to tutorial 02
   - Run "Restart Kernel and Run All" to confirm clean execution

2. Open `docs/tutorials/02_synthetic_validation.ipynb` in Jupyter and verify:
   - Three experiments are present with progressive narrative
   - Plots are visible and compelling
   - RIG_SIZE toggle is present
   - Run with "small" preset ("Restart Kernel and Run All") to confirm clean execution

3. Check `docs/tutorials/index.md`:
   - Lists exactly 2 tutorials
   - Descriptions match the practical-to-scientific arc

4. Verify learning path:
   - Tutorial 01 is practical ("here's how to calibrate")
   - Tutorial 02 is scientific ("here's why it works")
   - Forward link from 01 to 02 exists

5. Optionally build docs to verify rendering:
   ```bash
   cd docs && make html
   ```

  <action>Present verification checklist to user and wait for confirmation.</action>
  <verify>User provides approval or feedback</verify>
  <done>User has confirmed tutorials are correct and complete</done>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" or describe any issues to fix</resume-signal>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
User confirms tutorials meet TUT-01 and TUT-02 requirements.
</verification>

<success_criteria>
User approves both tutorials as running correctly with proper outputs and clear learning path.
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/12-tutorial-verification/12-03-SUMMARY.md`
