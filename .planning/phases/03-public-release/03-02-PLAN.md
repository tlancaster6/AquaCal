<objective>
Overhaul README with badges, feature highlights, and citation section. Prepare CHANGELOG for v1.0.0 release. Update CONTRIBUTING.md to reflect current tooling.

Purpose: The README is the first thing users and reviewers see. It must communicate quality (badges), capability (features), and citability (DOI/citation). The CHANGELOG formalizes the v1.0.0 release. CONTRIBUTING must reflect actual tooling (ruff, not black).

Output: Publication-ready README.md, release-ready CHANGELOG.md, accurate CONTRIBUTING.md.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Rewrite README with badges, features, and citation section</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Rewrite README.md with academic/technical tone per locked decisions. Structure:

1. **Title and badges** (first line after title):
   Badge order per decision: Build | Coverage | PyPI | Python | License | DOI
   Use shields.io badges:
   - Build: `![Build](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/tlancaster6/AquaCal/test.yml?branch=main&label=build)`
   - Coverage: `![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/tlancaster6/AquaCal?label=coverage)`
   - PyPI: `![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/aquacal)`
   - Python: `![Python](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/aquacal)`
   - License: `![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/tlancaster6/AquaCal)`
   - DOI: `![DOI](https://img.shields.io/badge/DOI-pending-lightgrey)` (placeholder until Zenodo mints DOI; update after release)

2. **Description paragraph**: Keep the existing technical description (it's already good and domain-appropriate). Trim the "Designed for researchers..." sentence.

3. **Feature list** (3-5 bullets per decision):
   - Snell's law refractive projection for accurate modeling through flat air-water interfaces
   - Multi-camera support with BFS-based pose graph initialization
   - Four-stage pipeline: intrinsics, extrinsics, joint refractive bundle adjustment, optional intrinsic refinement
   - Sparse Jacobian optimization with column grouping for scalable bundle adjustment
   - CLI (`aquacal calibrate`) and Python API for flexible integration

4. **Installation section**: Update to show `pip install aquacal` (PyPI) as primary, then dev install.

5. **Quick Start section**: Per decision, show BOTH:
   a. CLI workflow: `aquacal init --intrinsic-dir ... --extrinsic-dir ...` then `aquacal calibrate config.yaml`
   b. Python API snippet (keep existing `load_calibration` example, it's good)

6. **Keep existing sections**: CLI Reference, Configuration File Reference, Technical Methodology, Output, Using Results in Python. These are comprehensive and valuable. Only update the "Code Style" reference from Black to ruff if mentioned, and fix the broken link to COORDINATES.md (remove or update to valid path).

7. **How to Cite section** (new, near bottom before Contributing):
   - Non-binding citation request: "If you use AquaCal in your research, we would appreciate a citation:"
   - Reference CITATION.cff file
   - Provide a BibTeX snippet:
     ```bibtex
     @software{aquacal,
       title = {AquaCal: Refractive Multi-Camera Calibration},
       author = {Lancaster, Tucker},
       year = {2026},
       url = {https://github.com/tlancaster6/AquaCal},
       version = {1.0.0}
     }
     ```
   - Note: "See [CITATION.cff](CITATION.cff) for the canonical citation metadata."
   - DOI placeholder: "A DOI via Zenodo will be available after the first release."

8. **Contributing section** (brief, at bottom): Link to CONTRIBUTING.md.

9. **License section** (final): "MIT License. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details."

Important: Do NOT remove the detailed CLI Reference, Configuration Reference, or Technical Methodology sections. These are the README's strength for a research library. Just reorganize the top to lead with badges + features + quick install.

  <name>Task 2: Prepare CHANGELOG for v1.0.0 and update CONTRIBUTING.md</name>
  <files>CHANGELOG.md, CONTRIBUTING.md</files>
  <action>
1. **CHANGELOG.md**: Convert [Unreleased] to [1.0.0] release entry:
   - Change `## [Unreleased]` to `## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-14` (use today's date as placeholder; semantic-release may override)
   - Add a new empty `## [Unreleased]` section above it for future changes
   - Keep all existing "Added" items under [1.0.0]
   - Add link reference at bottom: `[1.0.0]: https://github.com/tlancaster6/AquaCal/releases/tag/v1.0.0`
   - Add link reference: `[Unreleased]: https://github.com/tlancaster6/AquaCal/compare/v1.0.0...HEAD`

2. **CONTRIBUTING.md** updates:
   a. Replace "Black (run `black src/ tests/` before committing)" with "Ruff (run `ruff format src/ tests/` before committing)" in Code Style section
   b. Add a "Commit Messages" subsection under Submitting Changes explaining conventional commit format:
      - `feat:` for new features (triggers minor version bump)
      - `fix:` for bug fixes (triggers patch version bump)
      - `docs:`, `test:`, `refactor:`, `chore:` for non-release changes
      - Example: `feat(calibration): add support for tilted water surfaces`
   c. Update step 5 in Submitting Changes from "Format your code with Black" to "Format and lint your code with ruff (`ruff format src/ tests/ && ruff check src/ tests/`)"
   d. Add pre-commit mention: "This project uses pre-commit hooks. Install with `pre-commit install` to automatically check formatting and linting before each commit."
  </action>
  <verify>
Verify CHANGELOG.md contains "[1.0.0]" section with date.
Verify CHANGELOG.md contains new "[Unreleased]" section above [1.0.0].
