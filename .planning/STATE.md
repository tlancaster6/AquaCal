# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-14)

**Core value:** Accurate refractive camera calibration from standard ChArUco board observations — researchers can pip install aquacal, point it at their videos, and get a calibration result they trust.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Foundation and Cleanup

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Foundation and Cleanup)
Plan: 0 of TBD
Status: Ready to plan

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- PyPI + GitHub distribution as standard for research Python libraries
- Real + synthetic example data to build trust and demonstrate correctness
- Jupyter notebooks for interactive, visual examples ideal for research audience
- License choice needed before public release (deferred to Phase 6)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 1:**
- License decision must be made before PyPI release (tracked for Phase 6)
- Cross-platform installation validation required (Windows/Linux, Python 3.10-3.12)

**Phase 2:**
- Real calibration dataset availability and size constraints (<50MB)
- Zenodo account setup for larger dataset hosting

**Phase 3:**
- Read the Docs account and repository integration
- Docstring completeness verification for all public API

**Phase 5:**
- Trusted Publishing setup on PyPI (OIDC configuration)
- Codecov account and integration
