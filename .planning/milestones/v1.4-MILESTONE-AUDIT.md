## Tech Debt

### Phase 10: Documentation Audit
- ~~Stale docstring in pipeline.py line 551~~ — FIXED (changed `result.interface.water_z` → `result.cameras['cam0'].water_z`)

### Phase 11: Documentation Visuals
- **Hero image redesign deferred**: User reverted new hero to original `hero_ray_trace.png` (commit 0175506). Generation script `hero_image.py` kept for future redesign. Accepted by user.

### Phase 12: Tutorial Verification
- ~~Stale references to deleted test_refractive_comparison.py in .planning/ docs~~ — FIXED (updated architecture.md, STRUCTURE.md, TESTING.md, CONCERNS.md)

**Total: 1 accepted item (hero image deferral), 2 fixed**
